# Drawing & Game Demo

This project demonstrates a simple drawing application and a basic game using HTML Canvas and JavaScript. It showcases event listeners for interactivity and a basic animation on the canvas element.

## Features
- **Drawing Program:** Use your mouse to draw freely on the canvas.
- **Game Demo:** A basic game that highlights animation, user interaction, and event handling in JavaScript.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML Canvas** for rendering graphics
- **JavaScript** for event listeners and game logic
- **Express.js** to serve the front-end content
